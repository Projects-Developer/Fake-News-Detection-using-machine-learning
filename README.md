### Abstract : 

Internet is one of the important inventions and a large number of persons are its users. These persons use this for different purposes. There are different social media platforms that are accessible to these users. Any user can make a post or spread the news through these online platforms. These platforms do not verify the users or their posts. So some of the users try to spread fake news through these platforms. These fake news can be a propaganda against an individual, society, organization or political party. A human being is unable to detect all these fake news. So there is a need for machine learning classifiers that can detect these fake news automatically. Use of machine learning classifiers for detecting the fake news is described in this systematic literature review.

Keywords: Online fake news, Machine learning, fake news, Text Classification, social media
